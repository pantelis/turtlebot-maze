# Legacy alias: vision behaviors (vision_behaviors.cpp, vision.py) subscribe to
# /camera/image_raw.  This bridge entry means no code changes are needed in
# tb_autonomy for the D435i swap — same alias pattern works in simulation and
# on the real robot (where a launch-file remap covers the same purpose).
