The devcontainer.json or docker-compose config references /workspaces/turtlebot-maze as the workspace folder, but that path is not created or mounted inside the container.

{"id":"turtlebot-maze-dwg","title":"Demo: navigate robot to desired location via ros-mcp-server","description":"Create a demo showcasing ros-mcp-server's ability to command the TurtleBot to navigate to a user-specified location using Nav2.\n\n## Context\nThe ros-mcp-server is already integrated (.mcp.json, rosbridge service on port 9090). The simulation world (sim_house) has 4 predefined locations in sim_house_locations.yaml:\n- location1: (-1.0, -0.5, -2.25)\n- location2: (0.5, 4.0, 0.785)\n- location3: (4.0, 0.5, 1.571)\n- location4: (2.75, 2.5, -1.571)\nRobot starts at (0.6, 0.6, 0.0).\n\n## Demo Flow\n1. Start the simulation: `docker compose up demo-world`\n2. Start rosbridge: `docker compose up rosbridge`\n3. Use ros-mcp-server tools from Claude Code to:\n   a. `connect_to_robot` (127.0.0.1:9090)\n   b. `get_topics` / `get_actions` to verify Nav2 is running\n   c. `subscribe_once` to /amcl_pose to confirm robot's current position\n   d. `send_action_goal` on /navigate_to_pose (nav2_msgs/action/NavigateToPose) to move the robot to a user-chosen location\n   e. `get_action_status` to monitor navigation progress\n   f. `subscribe_once` to /amcl_pose to confirm arrival\n\n## Permissions\nsend_action_goal is intentionally NOT pre-approved in .claude/settings.local.json — user must grant permission each time (safety gate for robot commands). Consider whether to add it to the allow list for the demo.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- Document the demo steps in a script or README section\n- Verify the full flow works end-to-end in the sim_house world\n- Show the robot navigating from its start pose to at least one of the 4 known locations\n- Capture the ros-mcp-server tool calls and their responses as part of the demo documentation","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","owner":"pantelis.monogioudis@aegean.ai","created_at":"2026-02-19T14:13:14Z","created_by":"Pantelis Monogioudis","updated_at":"2026-02-19T14:33:09Z","closed_at":"2026-02-19T14:33:09Z","close_reason":"Demo verified end-to-end: /navigate slash command connects to rosbridge, verifies Nav2, sends NavigateToPose goal to location3, robot arrives within 0.1m of target"}
